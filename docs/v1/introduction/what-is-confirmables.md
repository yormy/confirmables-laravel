## Features
Features that confirmables include:

### Messaging
- Manage the content of messages that go out in your database (no need for a developer to change an email)
- Add buttons, links, tables
- Use different styles for the messages

### Tracking
- Log all emails that are going out with the userId
- Show all emails that were sent to a specific user
- Track when an email has been opened (and from what IP address and user agent) (uses tracking pixels, so not all email clients support that)
- Track when a link was clicked in the email
- Allow for a developer to encrypt privacy data (email content /ip address)
- Exclude certain emails from their content being logged (for security)

### Subscribing
- Allow a user to unsubscribe to a certain email (only for unsubscribable emails)
- Manage the channels on where to receive notifications
